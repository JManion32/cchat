## Secure Messaging App using C++
Core features:
- Secure user login and authentication
- Direct messaging
- Group chats
- Simulated in-app purchases of cosmetic items (mainly application themes)
All sensitive and persistent data will be stored on the server in JSON files. The client will never directly modify these files; instead, it will communicate with the server via a custom TCP-based application protocol. Hosted with DigitalOcean.
